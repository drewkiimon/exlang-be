- Always @@map a table to the plural of the model name
- Every column that is camel cased (such as firstName) should `@map` to a snake case of the column name (firstName to `@map("first_name"))
- Never @map a single word column (such as uuid, id, and username)
- Every Date type should end with `at` (such as `createdAt`, which maps to `created_at`)
- Every model should have a `id`, `uuid`, and a `createdAt` by default
- ID for a model must look like `id Int @id @default(autoincrement())`
- UUID for a model is must look like `uuid String @unique @default(uuid())`
- All `@relation` must be done looking at the UUID of the models
